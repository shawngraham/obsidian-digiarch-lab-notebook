At the end of each week, you **log** all of the ephemera you have created, including a _log_ file and a _journal_ file. The log file is a record of what you've done; the journal is the joined-up thinking that contextualizes that work with what you've read/thought.

# Logging your weekly 'notes'

Being a digital archaeologist means keeping track of what you’ve done, as a gift to your future self (ie, so that when you come back to something, you can pick up where you left off). Make a new file here in obsidian, and use the `templates: insert template` command (ctrl+p to open the command palette, or hit the relevant icon on the tool ribbon) to insert the **log** template.

You can follow that template or modify it to suit your needs;  put into it any new terms you’ve encountered, commands you used, error messages you encountered, websites that helped, and so on. Bullet points and memos-to-self are fine. Change the name along this pattern: `week one notes`. 

When you're done, find that document in your vault/folder: it will be `week one notes.md` Upload this text document into your relevant weekly repo on github, along with any other files or digital things you happen to make. 

# Logging your reflective thinking

Being a digital archaeologist means you are always reflecting on what you've done, on how it changes what it is you can know, what it is you *do* know. Make a new file here in obsidian, and use the `templates: insert template` command (ctrl+p to open the command palette, or hit the relevant icon on the tool ribbon) to insert the **journal** template.

You can follow that template or modify it to suit your needs; jot down some reflections - narrative, or bullet points, whatever works for you; both are fine. Call it ‘journal-week-1.md’ Copy this document also to your relevant repo on github.

**Pay attention to the prompts**. You can answer them 1..2...3... if you wish; or you can look at them and ask yourself, what's the big-ticket issue he's driving at?

# Logging your Consolidation Docs

Again, make a new note and insert the relevant template into it; copy the resulting file to your  relevant github repo. Again, **pay attention to the prompts**. You can answer them 1..2...3... if you wish; or you can look at them and ask yourself, what's the big-ticket issue he's driving at?

The best consolidation documents alway demonstrate how you have integrated/reflected on/incorporated the feedback that I provided to you on the *non graded* weekly work.
